.SH NAME
hlfuzzy \- fuzzy command-line search utility for the hl://Dig search engine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hlfuzzy [-c configfile] [-v] algorithm
.I "[options]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Description to follow here
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c \fIconfigfile\fR
Use the specified
.I configfile
instead of the default. 
.TP
.B \-v 
.I Verbose mode
. Use this to get more verbose output while running hlfuzzy. More than one \fIv\fR can be specified (ie. 
.\fI-vv\fR
,
\fI-vvv\fR
 etc
). Specifying more than two v's is probably only useful for debugging purposes.
.SH "Supported Algorithms"
.TP
Different algoritms are supported for searching:
\fIsoundex\fR
Creates  a slightly modified soundex key database. Differences with the standard soundex algorithm are: 
Keys are 6 digits and the first letter is also encoded.
	      
\fImetaphone\fR
Creates a metaphone key database. This algorithm is more specific to English, but  will  get  fewer  "weird"
matches than the soundex algorithm.

\fIaccents\fR
(No description of the algorithm at the moment)

\fIendings\fR
Creates  two  databases  which  can  be  used  to match common word endings. The creation of these databases
requires a list of affix rules and a dictionary which uses those affix rules. The format of the affix  rules
and  dictionary  files are the ones used by the ispell program. Included with the distribution are the affix
rules for English and a fairly small English dictionary.  Other languages can be supported  by  getting  the
appropriate affix rules and dictionaries. These are available for many languages; check the ispell distribu-
tion for more details.

\fIsynonyms\fR
Creates a database of synonyms for words. It reads a text database of synonyms and creates a  database  that
hlsearch  can  then use. Each line of the text database consists of words where the first word will have the
other words on that line as synonyms.

.SH "Notes on searching"
.TP
Please consult specialised literature to find out how the different algorithms work or simply try another 
search stragegy you do not get the intended search results.
