	<strong>Release notes for htdig-3.2.0b6</strong> 02 Jun 2004<br>
	The next beta release of ht://Dig, 3.2.0b6, is now available.
	It fixes several bugs from 3.2.0b5, and runs somewhat faster,
	although still much slower than 3.1.6. (No significant speed
	improvements are expected in the near future, although we are
	working on it.)  Calling this release a "beta" simply means
	that exhausive testing, especially on non-Linux platforms, is
	not yet complete. However, we consider it stable enough for
	most production use.
	</p>

	<p>
	As with 3.2.0b5, if you are upgrading
	from a previous version, you should read the <a
	href="upgrade.html">upgrade guide</a> first.
	</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>fixed bug regarding compilation of regular expressions for
		every URL (improve performances)</li>
	    <li>fixed bugs in phrase searching</li>
	    <li>improved parsing of the configuration file</li>

		contain embedded spaces</li>
	    <li>added <a
         	href="attrs.html#store_phrases">store_phrases</a> attribute:

	<p>
	<strong>Release notes for htdig-3.2.0b5</strong> 10 Nov 2003<br>
	This version was slated to be 3.2.0rc1, but some final testing
	is still required.  It primarily fixes many bugs in 3.2.0b3, with
	some limited new functionality.
	As with 3.2.0b1 and 3.2.0b2, if you are upgrading
	from a previous version, you should read the <a
	href="upgrade.html">upgrade guide</a> first.
	</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>Fixed database bugs.  Introduced zlib compression to replace
	    buggy internal compression.</li>
	    <li>Forward-ported functionality from 3.1.6
	    (description_meta_tag_names, use_doc_date, ignore_alt_text,
	    ignore_dead_servers, boolean_keywords, boolean_syntax_errors,
	    multimatch_factor, translate_latin1)</li>
	    <li>Fixed bugs in phrase searching</li>
	    <li>Fixed compile problems due to deprecated C++ includes</li>
	    <li>Fixed bugs handling double slashes in URLs</li>

	    accept_language support</li>
	    <li>Implemented field-restricted searches (e.g. title:word)</li>
	    <li>Handle noindex_start/noindex_end as string lists</li>
	    <li>Implemented external converters,
	    text/html-&gt;text/html-internal</li>
	    <li>Improved support for MIME types</li>
	    <li>Changed licence to LGPL from GPL</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	<strong>Release notes for htdig-3.2.0b4</strong><br>
	This beta was never issued.
	</p>

	<p>
	<strong>Release notes for htdig-3.2.0b3</strong> 22 Feb 2001<br>
	This version is still marked beta because it has still only
	received limited testing and there are still revisions pending
	for the 3.2 releases. However, it adds more functionality and
	should address all serious bugs in the 3.2.0b2 release.
	As with 3.2.0b1 and 3.2.0b2, if you are upgrading
	from a previous version, you should read the <a
	href="upgrade.html">upgrade guide</a> first.
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Please note</strong> if you are updating from a prior
	release (3.1 or 3.2), the htmerge program has changed syntax as noted
	below. You will probably want to change your behavior to call
	htpurge instead of htmerge after htdig as noted below.
	</p>
	<ul>
	 <li>Fixed several non-exploitable bugs in handling external
	 parsers or transport agents.</li>
	 <li>Fix bug where changes in the robots.txt would be
	 ignored. If a URL was indexed and later the robots.txt
	 changed to forbid it, the URL would be checked anyway.</li>
	 <li>Fixed scoring bugs introduced in 3.2.0b2.</li>
	 <li>Fixed a non-exploitable security issue where content-type
	 headers were passed incorrectly to external parsers or converters.</li>
	 <li>Fixed bugs in the accents fuzzy algorithm, cutting down
	 on the size of the accent database.</li>
	 <li>Fixed a bug where duplicate documents would be generated when
	 merging a database with itself.</li>
	 <li>Fixed a bug in the new regex handling for indexing limits
	 where large patterns could fail and would be silently ignored.</li>
	 <li>Fixed minor bugs with the HTTP/1.1 implementation.</li>
	 <li>Fix a bug where an extra config= portion of a URL would
	 be output when using collections.</li>
	 <li>Fixed a bug with content-type declarations in external parsers
	 with combined content-type; charset declarations.</li>
	 <li>Fixed a bug in the config parser that did not correctly
	 handle relative config <a
	 href="attrs.html#include">include</a> statements.</li> 
	 <li>Fixed a bug in htfuzzy which would append to an existing
	 synonyms database rather than creating it anew.</li>
	 <li>Fixed problems with the configure script ignoring
	 --enable-bigfile flags.</li>
	 <li>Fixed problems with retrieval order--this could
	 potentially foul things up when limiting indexing by
	 hopcount.</li>
	 <li>Fixed some problems with the HTML in the included sample files.</li>
	 <li>Make the -l flag to <a href="htdig.html">htdig</a>
	 obsolete--this is now the default behavior -- the program
	 will intercept many signals and write a log file for a restart.</li> 
	 <li>Updated database format from the mifluz/htword project.</li>
	 <li>Changed syntax of <a href="htmerge.html">htmerge</a>. The
	 program now <em>only</em> merges databases. The <a
	 href="htpurge.html">htpurge</a> program will &quot;clean
	 up&quot; databases after running htdig. The included
	 &quot;rundig&quot; script reflects this.</li>
	 <li>htload now properly loads ASCII word databases.</li>
	 <li>Enhanced <a
	 href="attrs.html#build_select_lists">build_select_lists</a>
	 attribute.</li>
	 <li>Added support for controlling the number of Page buttons
	 in htsearch with <a
	 href="attrs.html#maximum_page_buttons">maximum_page_buttons</a>.</li>
	 <li>Added the METADESCRIPTION htsearch template variable for
	 displaying the &lt;META&gt; description field in output along
	 with the normal description, instead of using the <a
	 href="attrs.html#use_meta_description">use_meta_description</a>
	 attribute.</li>
	 <li>Added support for permanent URL rewriting with the <a
	 href="attrs.html#url_rewrite_rules">url_rewrite_rules</a>
	 attribute. (As opposed to the <a
	 href="attrs.html#url_part_aliases">url_part_aliases</a>
	 attribute which can provide a different URL to htsearch and htdig.)</li>
	 <li>Added support for restricting a search to match only
	 documents between two dates as specified in the <a
	 href="hts_form.html">search form</a> as well as the <a
	 href="hts_templates.html">template variables</a> STARTYEAR,
	 STARTMONTH, STARTDAY, ENDYEAR, ENDMONTH, ENDDAY.</li>
	 <li>Added support for limiting duplicates based on MD5
	 signatures with the new attributes <a
	 href="attrs.html#check_unique_md5">check_unique_md5</a>, <a
	 href="attrs.html#check_unique_date">check_unique_date</a>, <a
	 href="attrs.html#md5_db">md5_db</a>.</li>
	 <li>The documentation has been revised to include a block:
	 portion to note if attributes can be included in URL or
	 Server blocks. See the <a href="confindex.html"
	 target="_top">configuration</a> documentation for more
	 information.</li>
	 <li>More attributes are set on a per-server or per-URL basis.</li>
	 <li>New support for nttp:// protocol.</li>
	 <li>Added support for auto-generating directory listings for
	 file:// URLs.</li>
	 <li>Set the default compilation to enable tests that can be
	 run with &quot;make check&quot;</li>
	 <li>Greatly improved htnotify program with one message per
	 e-mail address and support for message
	 templates using the new attributes <a
	 href="attrs.html#htnotify_webmaster">htnotify_webmaster</a>,
	 <a href="attrs.html#htnotify_replyto">htnotify_replyto</a>, <a
	 href="attrs.html#htnotify_prefix_file">htnotify_prefix_file</a>,
	 <a href="attrs.html#htnotify_suffix_file">htnotify_suffix_file</a>.</li>
	 <li>There are the usual variety of other fixes and
	 changes. See the <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> for
	 more details.</li>
	 <li>Once again, a huge thank you to everyone who
	 contributed bug reports, fixes and patches!</li>
	</ul>

	<strong>Release notes for htdig-3.2.0b2</strong> 11 Apr 2000<br>
	This version is still marked beta because it has still only
	received limited testing. However, it adds more functionality
	and should fix all known bugs in the previous 3.2.0b1 release,
	including the security hole fixed in version 3.1.5 in
	production versions. As with 3.2.0b1, if you are upgrading
	from a previous version, you should read the <a
	href="upgrade.html">upgrade guide</a> first.
	</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>Fixed several bugs in the new HTTP/1.1 implementation that would 
	    cause problems with so-called &quot;Chunked&quot; data.</li>
	    <li>Fixed a bug in the new regex-based configuration options that 
	    would ignore the case_sensitive attribute.</li>
	    <li>Fixed the robots.txt parsing to more rigorously stick to the 
	    standard.</li>
	    <li>Fixed a bug where upper-case META robots directives would be 
	    ignored.</li>
	    <li>Fixed a bug that could leave a connection open when it failed.</li>
	    <li>Fixed the timeout in the connection code to ensure that hung 
	    connections are killed properly.</li>
	    <li>Fixed a bug where duplicates of modified documents could pile up 
	    over time.</li>
	    <li>Fixed a bug in the SGML entity handling where numeric entities 
	    would be ignored. (e.g. &amp;#162; -> &#162;)</li>
	    <li>Fixed a bug in the new configuration parser that
	    wouldn't accept lists including numbers</li>
	    <li>Fixed a potential infinite loop in the phrase
	    searching parser that came up when fuzzy algorithms were
	    used.</li>
	    <li>The HTML parser now ignores anything between &lt;script&gt; tags, 
	    much like it does for &lt;style&gt; tags.</li>
	    <li>Fixed some performance problems in the new word database code.</li>
	    <li>Removed the attributes translate_quot, translate_lt, translate_gt 
	    and translate_amp since all SGML entities are now encoded and decoded 
	    when displayed.</li>
	    <li>Removed the attribute uncoded_db_compatible since the 3.2 
	    databases are no longer compatible with previous versions anyway.</li>
	    <li>Removed the attribute word_list because the db.wordlist file is no 
	    longer generated. To get an ASCII version of the database, use the 
	    word_dump attribute.</li>
	    <li>Removed the pdf_parser attribute. It is now preferred to use the 
	    external parser or external converter support with xpdf.</li>
	    <li>The <a
	    href="attrs.html#wordlist_compress">wordlist_compress</a>
	    attribute is now turned on by default.</li>
	    <li>The output from htsearch and the default and included templates 
	    should now be more HTML-4.0 compliant.</li>
	    <li>Added support for searching collections of multiple
	    databases. To use this, supply multiple config fields or
	    config names separated by &quot;|&quot characters. Also
	    see the <a
	    href="attrs.html#collection_names">collection_names</a> attribute.</li>
	    <li>Added a new accents fuzzy algorithm, which treats
	    accented and unaccented words the same. You must create an
	    <a href="attrs.html#accents_db">accents_db</a> with
	    htfuzzy after indexing.</li>
	    <li>Added new attributes <a
	    href="attrs.html#tcp_max_retries">tcp_max_retries</a> and
	    <a href="attrs.html#tcp_wait_time">tcp_wait_time</a> to
	    control how many times a low-level connection is retried
	    and how long to wait on a hung connection.</li>
	    <li>Add <a href="attrs.html#any_keywords">any_keywords</a>
	    attribute to OR the keywords field in a search form
	    instead of AND-ing them together.</li>
	    <li>Add the attributes <a
	    href="attrs.html#search_results_order">search_results_order</a>
	    and <a href="attrs.html#url_seed_score">url_seed_score</a>
	    to control result ranking and scoring based on URL patterns.</li>
	    <li>Moved the htnotify program into the new httools directory.</li>
	    <li>Added the programs <a href="htdump.html">htdump</a>,
	    <a href="htload.html">htload</a>, <a
	    href="htstat.html">htstat</a> and <a
	    href="htpurge.html">htpurge</a>.</li>
	    <li>There are the usual variety of other fixes and
	    changes. See the <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> for
	    more details.</li>
	    <li>Once again, a huge thank you to everyone who
	    contributed bug reports, fixes and patches!</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
	<strong>Release notes for htdig-3.1.5</strong> 25 Feb 2000<br>
	This version cleans up some remaining bugs in the 3.1.4
	release. As the latest stable release of ht://Dig, it is
	recommended for all production servers.
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Fixed a nasty security hole in htsearch, which would allow
	    users to view any file on your site that had read permission.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that could cause problems with 8-bit
	    characters on some systems.</li>
	<li>Made some attempts to get htsearch's output to be more HTML 4.0
	    compliant. It quotes all HTML tag parameters, and uses ";"
	    instead of "&amp;" as parameter separator in URLs for next
	    pages. Reserved characters in parameters are now
	    encoded. Please note that this may break a variety of CGI
	    wrappers, for example, those written in PHP3.</li>
	<li>Fixed handling of SGML entities: htdig will still decode
	    them to store as single characters in the database, but
	    htsearch now encodes some of them back for compliant results.</li>
	<li>Added two new formats for variables in htsearch templates,
	    $%(var), which escapes the variable for a URL, and $&(var),
	    which HTML-escapes the variable as necessary.</li>
	<li>Fixed htdig's handling of robots.txt, such that only the first
	    applicable User-agent field bearing its name will be used, rather
	    than only the last.</li>
	<li>Fixed htdig's handling of servers that return 2-digit years.</li>
	<li>Fixed handling of embedded quotes in quoted string lists.</li>
	<li>Fixed handling of relative URLs with trailing ".." or leading
	    "//".</li>
	<li>Fixed handling of the
	    <a href="attrs.html#valid_extensions">valid_extensions</a>
	    attribute, which sometimes failed in the previous version.</li>
	<li>Enhanced the handling of local filesystem indexing with the
	    <a href="attrs.html#local_urls">local_urls</a>,
	    <a href="attrs.html#local_user_urls">local_user_urls</a> or
	    <a href="attrs.html#local_default_doc">local_default_doc</a>
	    attributes, which now allow multiple directory or file names to
	    be tried.</li>
	<li>Added the <a
	    href="attrs.html#build_select_lists">build_select_lists</a>
	    attribute to allow the config file to specify
	    &lt;select&gt; form elements in htsearch output as a
	    template variable, much like $(SORT) and $(METHOD).</li>
	<li>Added support for two additional configuration attributes:
	    <a href="attrs.html#max_keywords">max_keywords</a>, and
	    <a href="attrs.html#nph">nph</a>.</li>
	<li>A variety of other bug fixes, and many documentation updates.
	    See the <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> for details.</li>
	<li>Once again, thanks to everyone who reported bugs and bug
	    fixes.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	<strong>Release notes for htdig-3.2.0b1</strong> 4 Feb 2000<br>
	This marks the first beta version of the 3.2.0 codebase,
	over a year in the works. Since it has not received as much
	testing as the 3.1.x series, it is *not* recommended for
	production environments. A full description of how to upgrade
	is provided <a href="upgrade.html">here</a>.
	<blockquote><strong>NOTE:</strong> Read this document before
	upgrading. You have been warned.</blockquote>
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in htdig where hopcounts could be calculated
	    incorrectly between multiple servers.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that could cause problems with 8-bit
	    characters on some systems.</li>
	<li>Fixed handling of unreachable servers. First, the new <a
	    href="attrs.html#max_retries">max_retries</a> attribute allows
	    htdig to attempt multiple connections. Secondly, if the server
	    is not available, htdig will stop trying to connect.</li>
	<li>Fixed handling of SGML entities: htdig will still decode
	    them to store as single characters in the database, but
	    htsearch now encodes them back for compliant results.</li>
	<li>Rewrote the database formats, allowing room for more
	    sophisticated searches and compression of the word database
	    using the new attribute <a
	    href="attrs.html#wordlist_compress">wordlist_compress</a>.
	    These changes include the removal of the word_list file
	    (db.wordlist) and the addition of the new <a
	    href="attrs.html#doc_excerpt">doc_excerpt</a> database.</li>
	<li>Cleaned up many parts of the code, including the URL and
	    HTML parsers. Additionally, on platforms that support it, much
	    of the code will be built as shared libraries, which should
	    help memory utilization, especially under high load.</li>
	<li>Removed the modification_time_is_now attribute, which is
	    now on by default. This means the time at indexing is taken as
	    the date of the document if the server does not return a
	    date.</li>
	<li>Added the new attribute <a
	    href="attrs.html#use_doc_date">use_doc_date</a> to use the
	    date specified in a META date tag.</li>
	<li>Merged all heading_factor attributes into one new
	    attribute, <a
	    href="attrs.html#heading_factor">heading_factor</a>.</li>
	<li>As a result of the new database format, all _factor
	    attributes (like <a
	    href="attrs.html#title_factor">title_factor<a/> and <a
	    href="attrs.html#keywords_factor">keywords_factor</a> are
	    now dynamic--you do not have to rebuild your database to
	    change the scaling.</li>
	<li>Changed attributes <a
	    href="attrs.html#bad_querystr">bad_querystr</a>, <a
	    href="attrs.html#exclude_urls">exclude_urls</a>, <a
	    href="attrs.html#limit_urls_to">limit_urls_to</a>, <a
	    href="attrs.html#limit_normalized">limit_normalized</a>,
	    <a
	    href="attrs.html#http_proxy_exclude">http_proxy_exclude</a>
	    to allow full regular expressions when the regex are
	    surrounded by [ and ].</li>
	<li>Changed htsearch fields restrict and exclude to allow
	    regular expressions when the regex are surrounded by [ and
	    ].</li>
	<li>Added phrase searching support to htsearch--queries
	    enclosed in quotes will be checked to ensure the words
	    occur in that exact order in the documents.</li>
	<li>Added the <a
	    href="attrs.html#build_select_lists">build_select_lists</a>
	    attribute to allow the config file to specify
	    &lt;select&gt; form elements in htsearch output as a
	    template variable, much like $(SORT) and $(METHOD).
	<li>Added a regex fuzzy method. This will allow searches to
	    include regex that match words. The fuzzy method will
	    return up to <a
	    href="attrs.html#regex_max_words">regex_max_words</a> matches.</li>
	<li>Added a speling [sic] fuzzy method. This attempts several
	    simple spelling mistakes (like transposed letters and
	    extra letters) to find matches. This adds the new
	    attribute <a
	    href="attrs.html#minimum_speling_length">minimum_speling_length</a>
	    to restrict whether small words should be
	    checked. Transposing letters in smaller words can give
	    unrelated correctly-spelled words.</li>
	<li>Added support for external transport methods, using the <a
	    href="attrs.html#external_protocols">external_protocols</a>
	    attribute, an analogue of the external_parsers system.</li>
	<li>Added support for HTTP/1.1, including persistent
	    connections. This can be configured using the new attributes <a
	    href="attrs.html#persistent_connections">persistent_connections</a>,
	    <a href="attrs.html#head_before_get">head_before_get</a>,
	    and <a href="attrs.html#max_connection_requests">max_connection_requests</a>.
	    </li>
	<li>Added support for file:// URLs and support for using the
	    <a href="attrs.html#mime_types">mime_types</a> file to
	    decide whether local files are parsable.</li>
	<li>Added two new formats for variables in htsearch templates,
	    $%(var), which escapes the variable for a URL, and $&(var),
	    which HTML-escapes the variable as necessary.</li>
	<li>Added support for reading the list of URLs to index with
	    <a href="htdig.html">htdig</a> by supplying the
	    command-line option -.</li>
	<li>Added a flag -m to <a href="htdig.html">htdig</a> to index <em>only</em> the
	    files given in the filename.</li>
	<li>There are many more changes especially to the internal
	    code structure, so a huge thank you goes out to everyone
	    who helped make this release!
	</ul>

	This version cleans up some remaining bugs in the 3.1.3
	release. As the latest stable release of ht://Dig, it is
	recommended for all production servers.
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Fixed a nasty bug in URL parameter parsing, which was gobbling
	    up bare ampersands (&amp;) and CGI parameter names.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where htdig would go into an infinite loop if an
	    entry in <a href="attrs.html#local_urls">local_urls</a>,
	    <a href="attrs.html#local_user_urls">local_user_urls</a> or
	    <a href="attrs.html#server_aliases">server_aliases</a> was
	    missing the "=".</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in htsearch, where it failed when reading long
	    queries via the POST method.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in htdig, where it failed to close the connection
	    after certain errors.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that clobbered the hop count of initial documents.</li>
	<li>Fixed bugs in HTML parser's handling of META tags. It no longer
	    continues indexing meta tags when indexing is turned off for the
	    document, and it no longer gets confused by punctuation in META
	    descriptions and keywords.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the handling of the
	    <a href="attrs.html#case_sensitive">case_sensitive</a>
	    attribute, so that it's not limited to robots.txt
	    parsing. Now, if false, it causes URLs to be mapped to
	    lowercase, to avoid mixed case duplicates as expected.</li>
	<li>HTML parser now indexes text in alt parameter of img tags, and
	    calculates word locations more accurately than before.</li>
	<li>Digging via the local filesystem can now be done even without
	    an HTTP server running, and a few more file types can be indexed
	    locally, without having to rely on the server.</li>
	<li>Sender name in htnotify's e-mail messages is now quoted.</li>
	<li>The <a href="attrs.html#external_parsers">external_parsers</a>
	    attribute is now extended to support external converters, to avoid
	    a lot of the complications of writing external parsers.</li>
	<li>Added support for several new configuration attributes:
	    <a href="attrs.html#authorization">authorization</a>,
	    <a href="attrs.html#start_highlight">start_highlight</a>,
	    <a href="attrs.html#end_highlight">end_highlight</a>,
	    <a href="attrs.html#local_urls_only">local_urls_only</a>,
	    <a href="attrs.html#page_number_separator">page_number_separator</a>,
	    <a href="attrs.html#script_name">script_name</a>,
	    <a href="attrs.html#template_patterns">template_patterns</a>, and
	    <a href="attrs.html#valid_extensions">valid_extensions</a>.</li>
	<li>The keywords input parameter to htsearch is now propagated to
	    followup searches, as for other input parameters.</li>
	<li>The query string can now be passed to htsearch as a single
	    command line argument, for use in scripts.</li>
	<li>Added better examples and comments in sample htdig.conf, and
	    added boolean match type to sample search.html form.</li>
	<li>The HTML parser in htdig now turns off indexing between
	    &lt;style&gt; and &lt;/style&gt; tags.</li>
	<li>A variety of other bug fixes, and many documentation updates.
	    See the <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> for details.</li>
	<li>Once again, thanks to everyone who reported bugs and bug
	    fixes.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	<strong>Release notes for htdig-3.1.3</strong> 22 Sep 1999<br>
	This version fixes a number of bugs in the 3.1.2 release and
	is the latest stable release of ht://Dig. It is the only version
	recommended for production servers and users of all previous
	versions are suggested to upgrade.
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Fixed a long-standing bug where search queries containing
	    punctuation would not be highlighted in excerpts.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where SGML entities inside HTML tags were not
	    expanded.</li>
	<li>Fixed the <a
	    href="attrs.html#server_aliases">server_aliases</a>
	    attribute to default to port 80 if ommitted.
	<li>Fixed a bug in URL parsing, where documents ending in the
	    value used for remove_default_doc were ignored. For
	    example, a URL ending in /left_index.html would become /.
	<li>Fixed META robot parsing to correctly parse multiple
	    directives.</li>
	<li>Fixed a coredump when generating the metaphone fuzzy
	    database on some systems.</li>
	<li>Fixed the behavior of the <a
	    href="attrs.html#modification_time_is_now">modification_time_is_now</a>
	    attribute to work as documented.</li>
	<li>Fixed the behavior of htdig to block out the
	    username/password set on the command-line in process
	    listing.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug with external parsers to prevent shell escapes
	    in filenames.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug on some systems, where printing a date might
	    crash.</li>
	<li>Handles the ispell endings lists better so that suffixes
	    more closely match grammatical rules.</li>
	<li>Changed the maximum word length to a run-time option, set
	    with the new attribute <a
	    href="attrs.html#maximum_word_length">maximum_word_length</a>.
	<li>Tests for the presence of alloca.h, which would cause
	    problems with compiling the regex code under non-GNU
	    compilers.</li>
	<li>Added support for &lt;EMBED&gt;, &lt;OBJECT&gt;, and
	    &lt;LINK&gt; HTML tags.
	<li>A variety of other bugs were fixed, see the 
	    <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> for details.</li>
	<li>When indexing, htdig should now attempt to index compound
	    words as separate words in addition to a compound word. For
	    example, "pdf_parser" would also be indexed as "pdf" and "parser."
	<li>Once again, thanks to everyone who reported bugs and bug
	    fixes.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	<strong>Release notes for htdig-3.1.2</strong> 21 Apr 1999<br>
	This version fixes a number of bugs in the 3.1.1 release and
	is the latest stable release of ht://Dig. It is highly
	recommended for production servers.	
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug that ignored META description tags when they
	  were also added to the meta_keywords attribute.</li>
	<li>Fixed the HTML comment parsing to be more lenient about
	  non-standard comments.</li>
	<li>Fixed problems in the date-parsing code that made it Y2K
	  incompatible. In particular, it forgot that 2000 is a leap
	  year and wouldn't correctly parse dates after 29 Feb
	  2000.</li>
	<li>Fixed a variety of bugs in the HTML parser.</li>
	<li>Fixed an old bug that would exclude <strong>all</strong> URLs if
	  the exclude_urls attribute left empty.</li>
	<li>Fixed display of META description tags. Now it always
	  shows the top of a description. If no description exists, it
	  looks for the search terms in the excerpt as usual.</li>
	<li>Fixed some small memory leaks.</li>
	<li>Changed the htfuzzy endings algorithm to use a more
	  efficient regex system. Speed improvements on non-English
	  languages are noted, now taking minutes for generation that
	  would take days!</li>
	<li>Changed the noindex_start and noindex_end attributes to
	  allow case-insensitive matching.</li>
	<li>Added on-disk versions of the builtin templates to make it
	  more obvious how to change the results templates.</li>
	<li>Added <a href="attrs.html#date_format">date_format</a> 
	attribute to change the format of dates output in search results.</li>
	<li>Added <a href="attrs.html#extra_word_characters">extra_word_characters</a>
	   attribute that defines extra characters that should be
	  considered part of a word, rather than punctuation.</li>
	<li>Several other, relatively minor bugs were also
	  fixed. Many thanks to those who sent in bug reports and to
	  Gilles Detillieux for coordinating this release.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>

	  changed in version 3.1.0. This attribute must call the parser with
	  all command-line options.
	</ul>

	<p>
	  <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.1.0</strong> 9 Feb 1999<br>

	  <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.1.0b4</strong> 22 Dec 1998<br>
	  This version fixes a security hole in htnotify. The hole has been
	  present in previous versions but was inadevertently made worse in
	  the 3.1.0 beta releases. Malicious users could contstruct pages
	  that executed commands running under the shell of the user running
	  htnotify. <strong>It is highly recommended that users of previous
	  versions switch to this release.</strong>
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Fixed a memory leak in htnotify and htsearch.</li>
	  <li>Updated the contributed parse_word_doc.pl script.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	  <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.1.0b3</strong> 15 Dec 1998<br>
	  This version adds only a few features and a significant number of
	  bug fixes. This version has been pretty thoroughly tested. Though
	  there are a few remaining issues, it is hoped that this will be
	  near the end of the beta releases before version 3.1.0. Note that
	  it's recommended to update your databases to eliminate the
	  possibility of subtle changes in the database format.
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Fixed a bug which would ignore the proxy settings,
	  introduced in version 3.1.0b2.</li>
	  <li>Fixed a bug where words would remain from deleted
	  documents.</li>
	  <li>Fixed a bug where SGML &lt; was considered part of a tag
	  in the HTML parser, introduced in verison 3.1.0b2.</li>
	  <li>Fixed a bug where empty boolean searches would dump
	  core.</li>
	  <li>Fixed a bug where boolean "and," "or," and "not" would be
	  removed from a search string, causing a sytnax error.</li>
	  <li>Fixed a bug which wouldn't keep track of the hopcounts
	  correctly.</li>
	  <li>Added support for META refresh tags, contributed by Aidas
	  Kasparas</li>
	  <li>Added support for using CGI
	  <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">environment
	  variables</a> in the search templates, contributed by Gilles
	  Detillieux.</li>
	  <li>Improved memory requirements <strong>slightly</strong> through
	  fixing a memory leak in htdig and a general system-wide
	  adjustment.</li>
	  <li>Improved support for multiple exclude and restrict items
	  through htsearch, contributed by William Rhee and Gilles.</li>
	  <li>Improved support to compile under CygWinB20, contributed
	  by Klaus Mueller.</li>
	  <li>Upgraded to the latest version (2.5.9) of the
	  <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com/">Berkeley DB</a>
	  <li>Added a new option
	  <a href="attrs.html#server_wait_time">server_wait_time</a> to
	  give a delay between connections to a server. Currently this
	  can also affect local filesystem digging if set.</li>
	  <li>Added a new option
	  <a href="attrs.html#server_max_docs">server_max_docs</a> to limit
	  the number of documents pulled down from a server in one dig.</li>
	  <li>Added a new option
	  <a href="attrs.html#http_proxy_exclude">http_proxy_exclude</a>
	  to ignore the proxy setting on certain URLs.</li>
	  <li>Added a new option
	  <a href="attrs.html#no_excerpt_show_top">no_excerpt_show_top</a>to
	  show the top of a document when there is no excerpt.</li>
	  <li>Added new options
	  <a href="attrs.html#date_factor">date_factor</a>,
	  <a href="attrs.html#backlink_factor">backlink_factor</a>, and
	  <a href="attrs.html#description_factor">description_factor</a> to
	  improve search rankings. Respectively, they can give higher
	  rankings to more recent documents, documents with a high
	  number of links pointing to them, and documents with relevant
	  URL descriptions pointing to them. See the documentation for
	  more information.</li>
	  <li>Added a set of contributed scripts called multidig to help
	  work with multiple sets of URLs and databases.</li>
	  <li>Fixed many compilation problems under AIX, thanks to
	  Alexander Bergolth!</li>
	  <li>
	  Many other bugs were fixed, so a big thanks to everyone
	  who submitted a bug report, patch or gave other feedback! See the
	  <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> for more details.
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	  <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.1.0b2</strong> 1 Nov 1998<br>
	  This version adds a few minor features as well as many
	  bugfixes. It is still considered beta as some bug reports have not
	  been fully examined.
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	  Fixed a <strong>major</strong> database corruption
	  problem. Since this bug corrupted the document databases, to
	  completely fix it, you will need to rebuild your databases from
	  scratch.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Fixed many problems with the Makefiles and configure
	  scripts. Using <code>./configure --prefix=</code> now works.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Added fixes for connection problems with Digital Alpha-based
	  systems contributed by Paul J. Meyer!
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Added support for syslog-based htsearch logging. See the
	  <a href="attrs.html#logging">config documentation</a> for more
	  details. Thanks to Leo Bergolth for this!
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Added fixes to work with DNS aliases (as opposed to virtual
	  hosts) through the
	  <a href="attrs.html#server_aliases">server_aliases</a> and
	  <a href="attrs.html#limit_normalized">limit_normalized</a> options
	  as contributed by Leo Bergolth.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Added cleanups of the HTML parser and the connection timeout
	  code contributed by Ren&eacute; Seindal.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Now supports case insensitive servers through the
	  <a href="attrs.html#case_sensitive">case_sensitive</a> option.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Now supports ISO 8601 date format, using the
	  <a href="attrs.html#iso_8601">iso_8601</a> option.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Added a wrapper to emulate Exite for Web Servers (EWS)
	  contributed by John Grohol.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Added fixes to the contrib whatsnew.pl script to work with DB2
	  contributed by Jacques Reynes.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Added a new contributed synonyms file from John Banbury
	  <li>
	  Added a new template variable: CURRENT, the number of the
	  current match, from a patch by Ren&eacute; Seindal.
	  <li>
	  Many other minor bugs were fixed, so a big thanks to everyone
	  who submitted a bug report or a patch! See the
	  <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> for more details.
	  </li>
	</ul>

	  <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.1.0b1</strong> 8 Sep
	  1998<br>
	  This version adds several major new features as well as some
	  bug-fixes. It is considered a beta release since it has only seen
	  limited testing.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>
	    <font face="Helvetica" size="+1">It is <strong>
	    extremely</strong> important that you rebuild all your databases made
	    with previous versions. This version no longer uses the GDBM database
	    format and databases produced with it will be incompatible with other
	    versions. Do not blame me for anything if you didn't do this. You have
	    been warned...</font>
	  </p>

	</ul>

	<p>
	  <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.0.7</strong> 12-Jan-1997<br>
	  More bug fixes and some minor new functionality. Hopefully,
	  I'll be able to finish up work on version 3.1 at some point in

		a problem in the Dictionary class.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		htsearch is a *lot* faster due to a patch by Esa Ahola.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		htfuzzy has some work done to it. With the addition of the
		new rx-1.4 library, the endings algorithm now actually
		works for languages other than English... It still takes an
		awfully long time to build the tables for languages with
		lots of rules.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		URLs now can be of the dubious form http:foo.html I have
		never seen this used and think it is bogus, but alas, it
		works now.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		A search form can now manually add words to any search
		using the new <em>keywords</em> form attribute.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		A problem in the plaintext parser used to cause bogus HTML
		in search results. This has been fixed.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		New documentation format. Lots of new documentation, as
		well.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		New robotstxt_name attribute. Used to match the
		'user-agent' lines in robots.txt files.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		The &lt;base&gt; tag is now properly supported.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		Preliminary support for lots of new features, including:
		<ul>
		  <li>
			External document parsers. You'll be able to write your
			own document parser for that special document type that
			ht://Dig doesn't know about.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			New fuzzy search algorithms: substring, regex,
			globbing, etc.
		  </li>
		</ul>
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	  <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.0.6</strong> 26-Oct-1996<br>
	  Just a single bug fix and one additional feature in this
	  release.
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		Fixed the problem that caused frequent crashes with virtual
		memory exhausted.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		Added a new attribute, keywords_meta_tag_names, which
		should contain a list of meta tag names for which the
		content should be used as keywords. The default is set to
		"keywords htdig-keywords"
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	  <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.0.5</strong> 13-Oct-1996<br>
	  This release consists of more bug fixes.<br>
	  I want to thank Elliot Lee &lt;sopwith@cuc.edu&gt; for his
	  help with tracking down several bugs.
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		Fixed problem with accent characters. Words with SGML
		entities and iso-8859-1 characters will now be indexed
		correctly.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		Changed the auto configuration to detect the need for a
		prototype for the gethostname() function. (This was
		supposed to be fixed before, but wasn't)
	  </li>
	  <li>
		Reduced the memory requirements for all the programs by
		changing the rehash() method in the Dictionary class.
		Access to hashes may be a little slower, but the memory
		requirements were reduced by a factor 10 or so.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		Hopefully fixed a problem with the time related functions
		on certain platforms. More checks are done to make sure the
		functions that are used are actually available.
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	  <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.0.4</strong> 2-Sep-1996<br>
	  The previous version failed to build under Linux. This should
	  be fixed now.
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		Fixed problem with the time stuff which caused the build of
		htdig to fail.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		Fixed a memory problem in htdig
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	  <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.0.3</strong> 2-Sep-1996<br>
	  Bugs bugs bugs... Will they <em>ever</em> all be found?
	</p>
	<p>
	  <strong>NOTE</strong>: I made extensive changes to the htdig.conf file
	  that gets installed. I would advise you to remove or rename
	  your existing htdig.conf and let the installation process
	  create a new one for you that you can then modify.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Also, since the rundig script has changed, you should remove
	  the old one before installing ht://Dig. (The installation
	  will refuse to overwrite existing files...)
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		The problem with htsearch crashing on some machines has
		been fixed.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		A bug caused the &lt;AREA&gt; tab to be ignored. Fixed.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		A bug in SunOS caused dates to be all screwed up.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		Added lots of comments to the example htdig.conf file. Also
		added some additional example attributes.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		Fixed a bug in the installation process which caused rundig
		to be created incorrectly.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		Added a sample synonyms file. Also modified rundig to
		create a synonyms database for it.
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	  <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.0.2</strong> 22-Aug-1996<br>
	  More bug fixes.
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		Multiple start URLs now actually work. Before they were
		just documented to work, but didn't actually work.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		htmerge now will refuse to remove database files if it
		detects that the call to /bin/sort failed.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		htmerge can now tell /bin/sort to use a specific temporary
		directory. This is done by setting the TMPDIR environment
		variable.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		htsearch can now search for words with non-ASCII characters
		in them.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		Added support for finding URLs in the &lt;frame&gt; and
		&lt;area&gt; tags.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		There is a problem with htsearch under Linux. It causes a
		segmentation violation after the first search result is
		displayed. Don't know what the problem is, yet.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		Fixed bug in the auto configuration which always set the
		value for NEED_PROTO_GETHOSTNAME to 1. For most systems
		this actually needs to be 0.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<strong>Release notes for htdig-3.0.1</strong>
		16-Aug-1996<br>
		 This is a maintenance release in response to several bug
		reports.
		<ul>
		  <li>
			htdig now will display a list of errors when the
			statistics option (-s) is used. The list gives the URL
			that caused the error and a URL that referred to it.
			Hopefully this information is useful for site
			maintainers.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			Some problems with the SGML character entities were
			fixed. The major symptom was that the ';' that ends an
			entity used to be included as well.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			Major problems with htnotify were fixed. There were
			many hardcoded things in this program that made it very
			specific to SDSU and to me.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			malloc.h should not be included anymore. All references
			to it were replaced with stdlib.h instead. This should
			make compiles on some platforms work better.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			htsearch now will use the CONFIG_DIR environment
			variable to override the compiled in default. (set in
			the CONFIG file...) This was done so that htsearch can
			be called from a simple wrapper that sets that
			environment variable. Only the wrapper needs to be be
			modified to get different CONFIG_DIR values.
		  </li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>
	  <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.0</strong>
	  17-Jul-1996<br>
	  I decided to make this the <em>official</em> 3.0 release.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <blockquote>
		<font face="Helvetica" size="+1">It is <strong>
		extremely</strong> important that you remove all traces
		of earlier beta versions of the software before
		installing this version or that you install in a
		completely different location. Do not blame me for
		anything if you didn't do this. You have been
		warned...</font>
	  </blockquote>
	</blockquote>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		htwrapper is no more. htsearch is now the CGI program
	  </li>
	  <li>
		<a href="htsearch.html" target="_top">htsearch</a> now
		uses templates to display the results. A template is
		simply a piece of HTML code for a single match. The
		HTML code includes variables that will be expanded to
		the various items that are unique to each match, like
		URL, EXCERPT, TITLE, etc. The template can be selected
		at search time (through a menu). There are two builtin
		templates: <code>builtin-short</code> and <tt>
		builtin-long</code>. The <code>builtin-short</tt> template
		just lists the stars and title while the <code>
		builtin-long</code> template lists results in a similar
		fashion to the way Alta Vista displays results.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		Many runtime configuration options have been removed
		and many new ones have been added. Check the
		<a href="attrs.html">configuration file</a> documentation for
		details. There are also some enhancements to the format
		of the configuration file.
		<ul>
		  <li>
			Attribute values can now span multiple lines by
			ending each line that needs to be continued with a
			backslash ('\'). The file that is specified is read
			in and all newlines and starting and trailing
			whitespaces are reduced to a single space. If the
			file is not found, nothing is included and no error
			is flagged.<br>
			 Note that the backquote character is used, not the
			regular quote character.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			Attribute values can now include the contents of
			files. Just put the filename in back-quotes. The
			filename can use the normal variable expansion so
			that things like:
			<blockquote>
			  <code>someattribute: `${common_dir}/somefile`</code>
			</blockquote>
		  </li>
		</ul>
		Notable attribute changes:
		<ul>
		  <li>
			All the attributes that set the heading text have
			been removed. These attributes include:
			<ul>
			  <li>
				accessed_heading_text
			  </li>
			  <li>
				datesize_heading_text
			  </li>
			  <li>

			</ul>
		  </li>

				to index documents
			  </dd>

			  <dd>
				Used in the navigation between pages
			  </dd>
			  <dt>

				HTML file displayed if there was a boolean
				expression syntax error
			  </dd>
			  <dt>
				<strong>template_map</strong>
			  </dt>
			  <dd>
				Used in the support for the new result display
				templates
			  </dd>
			  <dt>
				<strong>template_name</strong>
			  </dt>
			  <dd>
				Sets the default template name
			  </dd>
			  <dt>
				<strong>text_factor</strong>
			  </dt>
			  <dd>
				Added to allow normal text to have a variable
				weight (0, for example...)
			  </dd>
			</dl>
		  </li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
		  <li>
			Some form tag names have changed. The list of
			recognized form tags are in the
			<a href="htsearch.html" target="_top">htsearch</a>
			documentation.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			Multiple start urls can be specified as a value to the
			'start_url' attribute. This could be combined with the
			file inclusion to read in a file of URLs to start with.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			<a href="htdig.html">htdig</a> now sends the 'Referer:'
			header in HTTP requests so that any link errors will be
			logged in the server's log files.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			In addition to the "htdig-keywords" META tag name,
			<a href="htdig.html">htdig</a> now also supports just
			"keywords". This is to make it more compatible with the
			Alta Vista search engine.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			The verbose display of <a href="htdig.html">htdig</a>
			was enhanced to show '+' for a link that will be
			followed and '-' for a link that was discarded.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			<a href="htmerge.html">htmerge</a> was changed to use
			the Unix sort program instead of doing its own sorting.
			It no longer uses mmap() to map the words into memory.
			This was causing problems on systems with limited
			virtual memory available. (What??? You mean you DON'T
			have at least a 1GB disk dedicated to swap???)
		  </li>
		  <li>
			The Endings algorithm was fixed up to work properly
			now. There were several well hidden bugs that made the
			algorithm come up with illegal words.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			The <strong>synonyms</strong> fuzzy algorithm was
			added. This is simply a mapping of words to other
			words. The input file is just a list of words which
			causes the first word on a line to be mapped to the
			rest of the words on that line. (We use this to map
			course abbreviations to full course names)
		  </li>
		  <li>
			SGML entities are now supported. They are translated to
			their equivalent ISO-8859-1 encoding.
		  </li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>
	  <strong>Release notes for htdig-3.0b5</strong>
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		The configuration has changed. There is now a CONFIG
		file which contains all the variables which control
		where things get installed. 'make install' will now
		actually attempt to set everything up with default or
		example files.<br>
		 Note that some default directories have changed. For
		example, the default configuration file location is not
		/usr/local/etc/htdig.conf anymore. Instead it is now
		defined in terms of CONFIG_DIR.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		The htfuzzy/createDict.pl Perl program has been
		obsoleted. Creating the endings database is now done by
		htfuzzy itself. If you already have endings databases,
		you don't need to recreate them, they will still work.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		GNU rx-1.0 is now included with the distribution. This
		is used by htfuzzy to create the endings databases.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		The name of the whole search system has changed from
		<em>HTDig</em> to <em>ht://Dig</em>.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		The HTML documentation got a big facelift! This
		includes the new logo for ht://Dig. (Thanks goes to
		Keith Parks for the Images!)
	  </li>
	  <li>
		htsearch got a new option '-r' which will allow it to
		produce raw output. This output can easily parsed by a
		wrapper program to produce custom HTML or other output
		for the search results.
	  </li>
	</ul>
