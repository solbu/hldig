.B Word Database
While htdump and htload don't deal with the word database
directly, it's worth mentioning it here because you need to
deal with it when copying the ASCII databases from one system
to another. The initial word database produced by htdig is
already in ASCII format, and a binary version of it is
produced by htmerge, for use by htsearch. So, when you copy
over the ASCII version of the document database produced by
htdump, you need to copy over the wordlist as well, then
run htload to make the binary document database on the target
system, followed by running htmerge to make the word index.
.TP
