            <p>
    The way hlsearch performs it search and applies its ranking
    rules are fairly complicated. This is an attempt at explaining
    in global terms what goes on when hlsearch searches.
  </p>
  <p>
    hlsearch gets a list of (case insensitive) words from the HTML
    form that invoked
    it. If hlsearch was invoked with boolean expression parsing
    enabled, it will do a quick syntax check on the input words.
    If there are syntax errors, it will display the syntax error
    file that is specified with the
    <a href="attrs.html#syntax_error_file">syntax_error_file</a>
    attribute.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the boolean parser was not enabled, the list of words is
    converted into a boolean expression by putting either "and"s
    or "or"s between the words. (This depends on the search
    type.)  Phrases within double quotes (") specify that the words
    must occur sequentially within the document.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a word is immediately preceeded by a field specifer
    (title:, heading:, author:, keyword:, descr:, link:, url:)
    then it will only match documents in which the word occurred
    within field.  For example, descr:foo only matches documents
    containing &lt;meta value="description" value="... foo ..."&gt;.
    The link: field refers to the text in the hyperlinks to a document,
    rather than text within the document itself.  Similarly url:
    (will eventually) refer to the actual URL of the document, not any
    of its contents.
    The prefixes exact: and hidden: are also accepted.
    The former (will) cause the
    <a href="attrs.html#search_algorithm">fuzzy search algorithm</a>
    not to be applied to this word, while the latter causes the word
    not to be displayed in the query string of the results page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each of the words in the list (but not within a phrase) is now
    expanded using the search algorithms that were specified in the
    <a href="attrs.html#search_algorithm">search_algorithm</a>
    attribute. For example, the endings algorithm will convert a
    word like "person" into "person or persons". In this fashion,
    all the specified algorithms are used on each of the words
    and the result is a new boolean expression.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next step is to perform database lookups on the words in
    the expression. The result of these lookups are then passed
    to the boolean expression parser.
  </p>
  <p>
    The boolean expression parser is a simple recursive descent
    parser with an operand stack. It knows how to deal with
    "not", "and", "or" and parenthesis. The result of the parser
    will be one set of matches.<br>
    Note that the operator "not" is used as the word 'without' and
    is binary: You can not write "cat and not dog" or just "not
    dog" but you can write "cat not dog".
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point, the matches are ranked. The rank of a match is
    determined by the weight of the words that caused the match
    and the weight of the algorithm that generated the word. Word
    weights are generally determined by the importance of the
    word in a document. For example, words in the title of a
    document have a much higher weight than words at the bottom
    of the document.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, when the document ranks have been determined and the
    documents sorted, the resulting matches are displayed. If
    paged output is required, only a subset of all the matches
    will be displayed.
