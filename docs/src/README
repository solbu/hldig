simplecgen uses the [simplectemplate library][sct_repo] to generate a web site.

(The library is included)

To build simplecgen:

    ./configure
    make

simplecgen will look for the **config file** in the same directory as the
binary file created after make is run.

See the README in the docs/ directory to learn how the html files are
generated.
