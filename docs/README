simplecgen will read from infiles/ and create html files
in the docs folder using the layouts in templates/

The {{title}} tag contained in the template files will be replaced by
the "title" line at the top of each .sct file.

The {{body}} tag contained in the template files will be replaced by
the html contents of each .sct file.

The "layout" line is used to determine the template.

Example: "layout:default" (located near the top of an .sct file), will
use templates/default.html

To build simplecgen, see the README in docs/src/.

Afterward, run simplecgen to generate the web site from the docs
directory:

    src/simplecgen

simplecgen uses the [simplectemplate library][sct_repo] to generate a web site.
